# Project Overview
This project is a solution to Homework #4 from the CS300 course at SabancÄ± University. The task involves sorting an unsorted phonebook using four comparison-based sorting algorithms and searching for names using two search algorithms. The program measures and compares the performance of each algorithm to identify the most efficient approach.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented:
Insertion Sort: A simple, but less efficient sorting method for larger datasets.
Quick Sort (pivot = median, with Insertion Sort for subarrays < 10): A faster sorting method, especially for large datasets.
Merge Sort (in-place): A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that performs efficiently, without auxiliary memory storage.
Heap Sort: A sorting method based on the heap data structure.

## Searching Algorithms Implemented:
Sequential Search: A linear search method, which compares each entry one by one.
Binary Search: A fast search method that operates on sorted data, using divide-and-conquer to quickly locate the target.

## Features
Phonebook Loading: The program reads an unsorted phonebook from a text file and loads it into multiple vectors to be sorted using different algorithms.
Full and Partial Name Search: Allows searching for full or partial names in the phonebook, returning all matches.
Performance Measurements: Sorting and searching times are measured in nanoseconds, and speedups between algorithms are calculated.
Comparison of Algorithms: Provides a detailed comparison of execution times for both sorting and searching, along with calculated speedups.

## How It Works
Input: The program asks for a file containing the phonebook and a search query (either full or partial name).
Sorting: Four different sorting algorithms (Insertion, Quick, Merge, Heap) are applied to the dataset, and their execution times are measured.
Searching: Sequential and Binary searches are performed on the sorted data, and the search times are compared.
Output: The program displays the sorting and search times, the speedups between algorithms, and the search results.
